This complex session builds strength through hills first, then challenges you to maintain tempo pace on slightly fatigued legs - excellent marathon-specific training.",

      "actual": "Pretty good. 3k easy to warm up, 5x 10sec hill sprints at maximum effort with jog-back recoveries, 3k tempo at 10k pace, 3k easy to cool down. Beautiful cool and clear morning."
