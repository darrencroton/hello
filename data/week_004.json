Be strict about not running marathon pace segments too fast - practicing exact race pace builds specific endurance needed for race day. Track morning heart rate tomorrow to monitor recovery."

Choose a moderate grade hill (4-6%) that allows you to maintain good form throughout. Effort should feel hard but sustainable for 3 minutes (approximately 5:30-5:45/km effort on flat ground)."
